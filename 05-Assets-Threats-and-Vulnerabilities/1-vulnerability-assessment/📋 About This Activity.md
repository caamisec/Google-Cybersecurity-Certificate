This project presents a comprehensive vulnerability assessment conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. The objective was to evaluate the security risks of a vulnerable information system for an e-commerce company and develop a detailed remediation plan. This activity demonstrates practical skills in risk assessment, threat analysis, and security control implementation essential for cybersecurity analysts.

## üéØ Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company that stores information on a remote database server accessible to employees working globally. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago, creating a serious security vulnerability. Your task is to complete a vulnerability assessment to communicate potential risks to decision makers and provide actionable recommendations for securing the server.

## üîç Applied Methodology

- **Framework**: NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (Risk Management Guide)
- **Assessment Type**: Qualitative vulnerability assessment
- **Approach**: Threat source identification, risk scoring, and remediation planning
- **Focus**: Business impact analysis and security control recommendations

## üìä Key Findings

### **Vulnerability Assessment Components:**

**Risk Assessment Matrix:**

- **Threat Sources**: Identified three potential threat actors targeting the vulnerable database
- **Threat Events**: Analyzed specific attack scenarios that could be initiated
- **Likelihood & Severity Scoring**: Applied 1-3 scale assessment for each identified threat
- **Risk Calculation**: Used formula (Likelihood √ó Severity = Risk) for overall risk scoring

**Business Impact Analysis:**

- Evaluated how database server provides value to business operations
- Assessed critical business functions that could be impacted
- Analyzed potential effects on business and customer relationships
- Determined priority areas for security investment

**Security Control Evaluation:**

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Access restriction recommendations
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered security approach
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Identity verification enhancement
- **AAA Framework**: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting implementation

## üéØ Analysis Results

The assessment revealed critical security vulnerabilities in the public-facing database server, with significant business risks identified through systematic threat analysis. The qualitative assessment provided stakeholders with comprehensive risk overview and actionable remediation strategies to protect organizational assets and maintain business continuity.
