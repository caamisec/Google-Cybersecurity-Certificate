This course explores the critical importance of protecting organizational assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. It develops understanding of asset classification and the practical application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to protect assets and mitigate risk. The course also focuses on developing a threat actor mindset to help protect assets from ever-evolving attack tactics and techniques used by cybercriminals.

## üìö What I Learned

This course deepened my understanding of asset security and vulnerability management. I learned effective data handling processes and the role of encryption and hashing in securing assets. The course taught me how authentication and authorization systems work to verify identities and control access. I gained skills in identifying common vulnerability exposures using MITRE frameworks, analyzing attack surfaces to find risks, and recognizing various threats including social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits. The threat modeling process became a key tool for staying ahead of security breaches.
