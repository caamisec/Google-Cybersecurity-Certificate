Hi there! I'm transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on becoming a SOC Analyst or Junior Security Analyst.

What really drew me to this field is threat detection and incident response - there's something fascinating about monitoring security events, analyzing potential threats, and staying one step ahead of bad actors. I have a natural eye for detail and systematic approach to analysis that serves me well when investigating security incidents and identifying suspicious activities.

I'm currently working through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate while studying Computer System Technician - Network here in Toronto. I also volunteer with a cat rescue organization, where I handle everything from screening processes to maintaining their website and managing sensitive records. This work keeps me sharp with confidentiality protocols, data management, and attention to detail.

My core values revolve around protecting organizations and maintaining strict confidentiality. I bring meticulous analytical skills, an investigative mindset, and strong documentation practices - all essential for effective SOC operations and incident response.

I'm documenting my cybersecurity learning journey here on GitHub, and I'm planning to start a blog soon to share insights about security monitoring and connect with the community. Always open to learning opportunities and connecting with fellow cybersecurity professionals!
