This course introduces the Python programming language and teaches how to apply it to cybersecurity settings for task automation. It covers foundational Python programming concepts including data types, variables, conditional and iterative statements. The course develops skills in creating functions, using libraries and modules, and writing readable code. Students learn to work with strings and lists, import and parse files, and apply debugging techniques to create efficient cybersecurity automation solutions.

## üìö What I Learned

This course gave me a solid foundation in Python programming specifically for cybersecurity applications. I learned fundamental programming concepts like data types, variables, conditional statements, and loops. The course taught me to write effective Python code by creating user-defined functions, working with libraries and modules, and following best practices for code readability. I gained practical experience working with strings and lists, using regular expressions to extract information from text, and opening and reading files for data processing. The debugging techniques I learned help me identify and fix code issues efficiently.
