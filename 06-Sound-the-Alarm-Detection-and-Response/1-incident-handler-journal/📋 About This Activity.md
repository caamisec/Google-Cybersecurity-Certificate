This project presents a **Portfolio Activity** conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. The objective was to maintain a comprehensive incident handler's journal throughout Course 6, documenting various security incidents, tool usage, and learning experiences in detection and response. This activity demonstrates practical skills in incident documentation, network analysis, and the systematic recording of cybersecurity investigations essential for incident response teams.

## üéØ Scenario

This incident handler's journal documents multiple cybersecurity scenarios and learning experiences throughout the course:

- **Entry 001**: Ransomware attack on a healthcare clinic with business operations shutdown
- **Entry 002**: Network traffic analysis using Wireshark packet capture tools
- **Entry 003**: Command-line packet capture experience with tcpdump
- **Entry 004**: Malicious file hash investigation using VirusTotal for SOC analysis

## üîç Applied Methodology

- **Tool**: Incident Handler's Journal for continuous documentation
- **Framework**: 5 W's analysis for incident investigation and tool evaluation
- **Approach**: Progressive skill development through hands-on tool usage
- **Focus**: Complete incident response lifecycle and network analysis capabilities
