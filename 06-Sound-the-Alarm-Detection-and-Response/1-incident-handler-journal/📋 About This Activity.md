This project presents a **Portfolio Activity** conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. The objective was to document a ransomware security incident using an incident handler's journal, demonstrating proper incident documentation procedures essential for cybersecurity incident response teams. This activity showcases practical skills in incident analysis, documentation, and the application of the 5 W's framework for thorough incident recording.

## üéØ Scenario

A small U.S. healthcare clinic specializing in primary care services experienced a ransomware attack on Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported inability to access their computers and files, including medical records. Business operations shut down due to inaccessible files and software. The attackers used targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain network access, then deployed ransomware that encrypted critical files, demanding ransom payment for decryption keys.

## üîç Applied Methodology

- **Tool**: Incident Handler's Journal documentation template
- **Framework**: 5 W's analysis (Who, What, When, Where, Why)
- **Approach**: Systematic incident documentation and analysis
- **Focus**: Ransomware attack documentation and incident response procedures

## üìä Key Findings

### **Incident Documentation Components:**

**Attack Vector Analysis:**

- **Initial Access**: Targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments
- **Malware Deployment**: Ransomware encryption of critical business files
- **Business Impact**: Complete shutdown of clinic operations and patient data access
- **Threat Actor**: Organized group targeting healthcare and transportation industries

**5 W's Analysis:**

- **Who**: Organized group of unethical hackers specializing in healthcare targets
- **What**: Ransomware attack encrypting company files with ransom demand
- **When**: Tuesday morning, approximately 9:00 a.m.
- **Where**: Small U.S. healthcare clinic providing primary care services
- **Why**: Phishing email with malicious attachment exploiting employee lack of security awareness

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Proper incident timeline and chronology
- Detailed description of attack methodology
- Business impact assessment and operational disruption
- Recovery and prevention recommendations

## üéØ Analysis Results

The incident handler's journal provided comprehensive documentation of a sophisticated ransomware attack targeting healthcare infrastructure. The systematic documentation approach using the 5 W's framework ensured complete incident analysis and created valuable reference material for future incident response and prevention strategies.
