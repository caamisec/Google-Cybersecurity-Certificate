This course focuses on incident detection and response, core competencies for cybersecurity professionals. It covers the complete incident response lifecycle, including the roles and responsibilities of incident response teams. The course provides hands-on experience with network monitoring tools, packet analysis, and security incident investigation procedures. Students learn to use industry-standard tools like IDS, SIEM platforms, and packet sniffers to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats.

## üìö What I Learned

This course developed my practical incident response skills through hands-on experience with security tools and investigation techniques. I learned the complete incident response lifecycle and how to document incidents properly using incident handler's journals. The course taught me to analyze network communications using packet sniffing tools like tcpdump and Wireshark, and how to perform artifact investigations to verify security incidents. I gained experience with intrusion detection systems (IDS) like Suricata and SIEM tools including Splunk and Google SecOps (Chronicle), learning to read logs, interpret signatures, and perform security investigations.
