## üìñ Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to network architecture, operations, and security. It focuses on understanding how networks function, common network protocols, and the various methods used to protect networks from intrusions. The course emphasizes practical skills in network analysis, security hardening, and incident response that entry-level cybersecurity analysts use when securing network infrastructure.

## üìö What I Learned

This course gave me a solid foundation in network security concepts. I learned how to analyze network architecture and understand how data flows through different types of networks using the TCP/IP model. The course taught me to identify common network vulnerabilities and recognize various network attack methods. I gained practical experience with network analysis tools like tcpdump, learned about network security measures including firewalls and VPNs, and developed skills in network hardening techniques to prevent intrusions.
