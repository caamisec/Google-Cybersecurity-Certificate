This project presents a **Portfolio Activity** conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. The objective was to create a comprehensive incident report using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to analyze a DDoS attack and develop a strategic security improvement plan. This activity demonstrates the practical application of the CSF framework in real-world cybersecurity incident response.

## üéØ Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. The organization experienced a DDoS attack that compromised the internal network for two hours. During the attack, network services stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets through an unconfigured firewall. The incident required immediate response and long-term security improvements.

## üîç Applied Methodology

- **Framework**: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - 5 core functions
- **Approach**: Structured incident analysis and strategic security planning
- **Analysis Components**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover phases
- **Focus**: Network security improvement and DDoS attack prevention

## üìä Key Findings

### **Incident Analysis Using NIST CSF:**

**Identify:**

- Unconfigured firewall vulnerability identified
- Network infrastructure security gaps assessed
- Critical asset inventory and risk evaluation

**Protect:**

- New firewall rules implemented to limit ICMP packet rates
- Source IP address verification configured
- IDS/IPS system deployed for traffic filtering

**Detect:**

- Network monitoring software implemented
- Abnormal traffic pattern detection capabilities enhanced
- Continuous monitoring procedures established

**Respond:**

- Incident containment and neutralization procedures
- Critical service restoration protocols
- Security process improvement recommendations

**Recover:**

- Network service restoration to normal operations
- System data and asset recovery procedures
- Business continuity maintenance strategies

## üéØ Analysis Results

The comprehensive analysis using the NIST CSF framework provided a structured approach to understanding the DDoS incident and developing a robust security improvement plan. The framework enabled systematic identification of vulnerabilities, implementation of protective measures, enhancement of detection capabilities, and establishment of effective response and recovery procedures.
