This project presents a network hardening assessment conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. The objective was to analyze a major data breach at a social media organization, identify critical network vulnerabilities, and recommend specific hardening tools and methods to prevent future security incidents.

## 🎯 Scenario

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach, compromising customers' personal information including names and addresses. After inspecting the organization's network, four major vulnerabilities were discovered: shared employee passwords, default admin database password, firewalls without traffic filtering rules, and lack of multifactor authentication (MFA). The organization needs to implement strong network hardening practices to prevent future attacks.

## 🔍 Applied Methodology

- **Approach**: Vulnerability assessment and risk analysis
- **Focus**: Network hardening practices and security controls implementation
- **Analysis**: Critical vulnerability prioritization and remediation planning
- **Framework**: Preventive security measures for consistent network protection

## 📊 Key Findings

### **Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:**

**Security Gaps:**

- Employee password sharing practices
- Default administrative passwords in use
- Unfiltered network traffic (no firewall rules)
- Missing multifactor authentication implementation

**Risk Assessment:**

- High probability of future data breaches
- Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data
- Network infiltration through multiple attack vectors
- Compliance and regulatory violations potential

## 🎯 Analysis Results

The assessment revealed multiple critical security vulnerabilities that created a weak security posture for the organization. The recommended hardening measures focus on password policies, firewall configuration, and employee security education to establish a comprehensive defense strategy against future attacks.
